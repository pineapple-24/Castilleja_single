# Castilleja_single
mp3 
D dorian  174 bpm.
song written by me, Brandon Thompson and soon to 
establish an online presence via "Bottlejack"

 
 song started with me tinkering with the dsus2 chord and going down am to Gmaj. 
this is the first time ive ever created and recorded a full song in a week. 
so im getting faster.
though theres still some things i want to change:
-get the bouzouki accoustic better via mic placement
-some tweaking of words in the end of the chorus

but overall quite happy. this is in line with the music or scope i have 
in my mind of where I am and going. im not a high distortion, instead prefer
lots of clean sounds, accoustics etc. especially in the mix when theres
a lot of instruments and vocals going

I have other 'EP's written, but its a back log. i started singing lessons 
in dec 2024 and am getting better at fitting lyrics, melody and recording it. 
Im a bass barritone with alto, so when i pick a melody the octave plays a big part
in the tone.
